# AppSpace Marketplace â€” Portfolio Project

## Key Features  
- User registration and role management (buyers and sellers)  
- Dynamic app listings with search and purchase functionality  
- Secure payment integration (Stripe)  
- Store creation and management for sellers  
- Admin dashboard for managing orders and users  

## Technologies & Tools  
- Backend: Ruby on Rails 5.2.3 (MVC architecture)  
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, CoffeeScript, Bootstrap  
- Database: PostgreSQL  
- Deployment: Heroku (PaaS)  
- Version Control: Git, GitHub  
- Design & Collaboration: Figma, Trello (Agile Kanban board)  
- Testing: Manual browser testing, Rails console, debugging with Byebug  
- Third-party Gems: Devise (authentication), CanCanCan (authorization), Stripe (payments)

Register a store and become a seller
Add new app listings that appear on the main listings page
Use the Stripe integration to securely purchase apps and receive download access

# Git Workflow
Each person worked on their own branch
We used pull requests to review and merge code
Tried to keep merges small to avoid conflicts

# Testing
Manual testing through the browser
Used Rails console and Byebug to test data and logic
Checked forms, payments, and role-based access
